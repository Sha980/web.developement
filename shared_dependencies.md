1. "index.html": This is the main HTML file that will contain the structure of the website. It will include references to the "styles.css" and "tailwind.css" files. It will contain the id names of the DOM elements that may be used by potential JavaScript functions.

2. "styles.css": This is the main CSS file that will contain custom styles for the website. It will use class names and id names that are shared with the "index.html" file.

3. "tailwind.css": This is the Tailwind CSS file that will contain the utility classes used for styling the website. It will be referenced in the "index.html" file and its classes will be used in the HTML elements.

Shared Dependencies:

1. HTML Element IDs: These are unique identifiers for HTML elements that can be used by CSS for styling and potentially by JavaScript for DOM manipulation. They will be shared between "index.html", "styles.css", and potentially any JavaScript files.

2. CSS Class Names: These are identifiers for groups of styling rules in CSS. They will be shared between "index.html", "styles.css", and "tailwind.css".

3. CSS Selectors: These are patterns used to select the element(s) you want to style. They will be shared between "index.html", "styles.css", and "tailwind.css".

4. File References: The "index.html" file will have references (links) to the "styles.css" and "tailwind.css" files, allowing it to use the styles defined in these files.

5. Tailwind Utility Classes: These are classes provided by Tailwind CSS for styling. They will be used in the "index.html" file and defined in the "tailwind.css" file.
