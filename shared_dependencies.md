The shared dependencies between the files we are generating are:

1. **Next.js**: This is the main framework used for building the application. It is used in all the files for server-side rendering and routing.

2. **React**: Next.js is built on top of React, so React is a shared dependency across all the files. It is used to create components and manage the application's state.

3. **TypeScript**: TypeScript is used across all the files for type checking and improved developer experience. It is used in the tsconfig.json file to configure the TypeScript compiler, and in the .tsx files to write typed JavaScript.

4. **Package.json**: This file contains the list of project dependencies and scripts. It is shared across all the files as it determines the packages that need to be installed for the project to run.

5. **tsconfig.json**: This file is used to specify the root files and the compiler options required to compile the project. It is shared across all TypeScript files (.tsx).

6. **_app.tsx**: This file is used to initialize pages. It has shared dependencies with all the pages in the application as it wraps around all the pages.

7. **_document.tsx**: This file is used to augment the application's html and body tags. It is shared across all the pages in the application.

8. **globals.css**: This file contains global styles that are shared across all the pages in the application.

9. **favicon.ico**: This file is the website's icon, and it is shared across all the pages in the application.

10. **.gitignore**: This file is used to tell git which files (or patterns) it should ignore. It is shared across all the files in the project.

11. **README.md**: This file contains information about the project and it is shared across all the files in the project.
